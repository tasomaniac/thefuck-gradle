The Fuck rule for Gradle

As simple as the tool the fuck. [The Fuck][fuck] is a magnificent app which corrects your previous console command.

Usage
-----

When you type a Gradle task wrong, just type `fuck` after that and corrected task will be run.

Install
-------

Copy the `gradle.py` file to `~/.thefuck/rules/` folder.

After that you have to enable it. 

First way is to edit `~/.thefuck/settings.py` file and it to the rules. 

```
rules = ['gradle']
require_confirmation = False
wait_command = 10
no_colors = False
debug = False
```

When it is done this way, I couldn't find a way to keep `DEFAULT_RULES`, you have to add the other rules manually, which is bad. 

The other way is to add an environment variable. In environment variable, you can directly add `DEFAULT_RULES`. Here is how:

```
export THEFUCK_RULES=DEFAULT_RULES:gradle
```
